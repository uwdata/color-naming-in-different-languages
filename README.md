# Many Languages, Many Colors Dataset
## Color Naming Data, Models, Translations, and Visualizations

Official Website is located at [https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages)

This repository contains color data, processing, and visualization code from the project that resulted in [our EuroVis paper](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/multi-lingual-color-names/), including:

- Color-name judgements that are collected from our 12 minute [color perception survey](http://labinthewild.org/studies/color_perception/) on [LabIntheWild](https://labinthewild.org/)
- Color naming probabilistic models for _hue colors_ and _full colors_
- Interactive visualizations
  - [Color Translator](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/color_compare.html) Finds similar colors in the same language or across languages.
  - [The probabilities of terms for each hue color bin across 14 languages](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/color-composition-figure.html)
  - [Interactive version of the above](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/stacked-spectrum.html)
  - [Maximum Probability Maps for English and Korean color names](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/full_color_maps.html)
  - [Comparison of translations](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/en-ko-translation-comparison.html)
  - [The probabilities of viridis colors for some nameable terms](https://uwdata.github.io/color-naming-in-different-languages/vis/viridis.html)


## Paper Data (from prior to our updates)
Note: The old paper versions of the data and visualizations are in the "2019_paper_version" subfolder, and the visualizations are available here:
